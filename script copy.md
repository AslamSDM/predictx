# PredictX Demo Script

**(0-30 seconds) Introduction to PredictX**

"Hello everyone. Today, I'd like to introduce you to PredictX, a platform designed for cryptocurrency price predictions. It features a modern user interface and a user experience inspired by dating apps. We've also integrated social finance components, such as chat rooms for each prediction, user profiles, and an AI chat."

**(30-90 seconds) Core Prediction Functionality and User Experience**

"On PredictX, any user can create a cryptocurrency price prediction. This involves posting your analysis, setting a price target, and defining an expiration time. Our social finance features include a user profile page where you can see stats like your number of followers, bets placed, and total earnings."

"When a prediction is open for voting, users can buy YES or NO token shares based on their belief in the prediction's outcome. These purchases are made using PYUSD tokens, which serve as our main liquidity token."

"If a user wishes to change their position, they can sell their current shares and buy the opposing shares while the market is open. Once the expiration time passes, no further share purchases are allowed."

"The process of buying tokens is designed to be intuitive, drawing inspiration from dating apps like Tinder. To buy YES shares, you swipe right; for NO shares, you swipe left. If you prefer not to participate in a particular prediction, you can swipe up to move to the next one. You can also swipe down to revisit previous predictions, making the navigation very straightforward."

**(90-150 seconds) Resolution Process with Pyth Network**

"After a prediction has expired, any network participant can report its outcome by calling a function on our smart contract. We also provide an interactive UI to help users resolve predictions. Resolvers receive a small fee from the prediction's total pool. The system then automatically fetches price feeds from Pyth, marking the prediction as resolved. This allows participants to redeem their winning tokens for PYUSD."

**(150-210 seconds) Social Features and AI with Blockscout MCP**

"Each prediction on PredictX has its own dedicated chat room. Here, participants can discuss and interact with each other directly within the platform, eliminating the need to switch to external social media. Within each chatroom, an AI is available to share insightful analysis about the prediction. This AI is powered by Blockscout MCP technology."

**(210-270 seconds) User Profile and Redemption**

"Token redemption is handled through the user's profile page. On this page, users can view their personal statistics, such as how much they've bet and how many predictions they've made. From here, they can select a concluded prediction they participated in and redeem their rewards in PYUSD."

"PredictX is built on the Sepolia blockchain, and off-chain price feeds are securely fetched from the Pyth price feeds oracle using a pull method."

**(270-300 seconds) Conclusion**

"In summary, PredictX offers a unique and engaging way to participate in cryptocurrency price predictions, combining an intuitive user experience with robust social and analytical tools, all powered by PYUSD, Pyth, and Blockscout MCP."
